# Data_Structures-HangmanSTL
A console application representing the classic Hangman game. It was done as a practice to get more familiar with the Standard Template Library.

The game keeps a collection of possible words to guess in word_bank.txt. The player can add words to the bank and view the bank's contents. How the game is played is explained within the game under the game rules menu. Note that the scoreboards are not fully implemented and the quality of their functionality is not guaranteed. Everything else should work like a charm.

Enjoy!
